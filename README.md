### Project Title
Bikeshare Project

### Description
This is my bikeshare project for Udacity.
It asks for user input of the city, month and day. It then applies these filters to the chicago, new_york_city and washington files and calculates basic statistics such as:
1. The Most Frequent Times of Travel
2. The Most Popular Stations and Trip
3. Trip Duration
4. User Stats

For each group of statistics calculated it will print the time taken. After all statistics are calculated it will ask the user if they would like to see lines of raw data.


### Files used
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
* Bikeshare Project.ipynb
* bikeshare_2.py
